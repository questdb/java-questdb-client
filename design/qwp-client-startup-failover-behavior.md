# QWP client startup, pooling, failover, and store-and-forward

This document describes how the Java QWP client behaves at **startup**, under
**connection loss**, and with **store-and-forward (SF)** durability. It is
written for client *users* first: the [Quick start](#quick-start) and
[Mental model](#mental-model) sections are enough to configure a correct client.
The [Reference](#reference) section is the exhaustive behavior matrix. The
[Implementation appendix](#implementation-appendix) documents internals for
maintainers.

It is descriptive — it records what the code does today, including current
sharp edges. Where a behavior is a likely footgun, it is marked
**⚠ Sharp edge** and tracked in
[`qwp-client-ergonomics-issues.md`](./qwp-client-ergonomics-issues.md).

---

## Quick start

### Write-only client that tolerates the server being down at startup

Use the direct `Sender` API (not the `QuestDB` facade — see
[sharp edge #4](#sharp-edges)).

```java
String cfg = "ws::addr=db-a:9000,db-b:9000;"
        + "sf_dir=/var/lib/my-app/questdb-sf;"   // opt into disk durability
        + "sender_id=writer-1;"                  // unique per process per sf_dir
        + "initial_connect_retry=async;"         // non-blocking startup
        + "reconnect_max_duration_millis=86400000;" // outage budget (24h)
        + "sf_max_total_bytes=100g;";

// For production, prefer the builder so you can install an error handler:
try (Sender sender = Sender.builder(cfg)
        .errorHandler(myErrorHandler)            // see "Error visibility" below
        .connectionListener(myConnectionListener)
        .build()) {
    sender.table("telemetry").longColumn("v", 42).atNow();
    sender.flush(); // persists to SF storage; wire ACK is asynchronous
}
```

Why each line matters:

- `sf_dir` is the **only** SF enable switch — there is no boolean flag.
- `initial_connect_retry=async` is what makes `build()` return without a live
  socket. Without it, startup is blocking (see [Mental model](#mental-model)).
- `reconnect_max_duration_millis` is the outage budget for **both** the initial
  connect and later reconnects. If it expires, the sender latches terminal and
  stops; data already in `sf_dir` survives for a future sender on the same slot.

**Error visibility ⚠:** the simplest path (`Sender.fromConfig(...)` + async)
surfaces terminal async failures only *later*, through a producer call or at
`close()`. For production, use `Sender.builder(...)` and install a
`SenderErrorHandler` / `SenderConnectionListener`
([sharp edge #7](#sharp-edges)).

### Read client that only reads from replicas

```java
String cfg = "ws::addr=replica-a:9000,replica-b:9000,replica-c:9000;"
        + "target=replica;"   // without this, the client may bind a primary
        + "failover=on;";      // default; affects execute()-time recovery only

try (QuestDB db = QuestDB.connect(cfg)) {
    db.executeSql("select * from telemetry limit 10", myBatchHandler);
}
```

Why each line matters:

- `target=replica` is required to avoid binding a primary/standalone server.
  The default `target=any` will accept any role.
- `failover=on` is the default. It does **not** affect startup; it only governs
  reconnect+replay after a query connection that was already established later
  fails during `execute()`.

## Mental model

### Three independent "connect" models live in one client

A `QuestDB` facade owns an **ingest pool** and a **query pool**. They do not
share a startup model. You must hold all three in mind:

| Concern | Controlled by | Startup is... |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ingest sender initial connect | `initial_connect_retry` = `off` / `sync` / `async` | one-shot / blocking-retry / background-retry |
| Query client initial connect | (no mode; always synchronous) | always blocking |
| Facade prewarm (how many of each connect at `build()`) | `sender_pool_min`, `query_pool_min` | eager if `min>0`, lazy if `min=0` |

`failover=on` (query default) is **not** a startup setting — it only affects
query execution after a connection exists. This naming trips people up
([sharp edge #3](#sharp-edges)).

### Ingest initial-connect modes

| `initial_connect_retry` | Mode | `build()` behavior on a down server |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `off` / `false` | `OFF` | one attempt on caller thread; throws immediately |
| `on` / `true` / `sync` | `SYNC` | retry loop on caller thread, bounded by `reconnect_max_duration_millis` (blocks) |
| `async` | `ASYNC` | returns immediately; I/O thread retries in background |

**Default resolution ⚠:** if you don't set `initial_connect_retry` explicitly but
you *do* set any `reconnect_*` knob, the mode becomes `SYNC` — so a "resilience"
knob silently turns startup into a multi-minute **blocking** retry. If no
`reconnect_*` knob is set either, the mode is `OFF`. Always set
`initial_connect_retry` explicitly to avoid this ([sharp edge #1](#sharp-edges)).

### Facade prewarm

`QuestDBBuilder.build()` validates both configs (without connecting), then
eagerly creates `min` connections per pool. Consequences:

| Configuration | Build-time network behavior |
| --- | --- |
| defaults (`min=1` both) | creates one sender + one query client; build fails if either cannot connect — unless ingest uses `initial_connect_retry=async` |
| `sender_pool_min=0` | no sender at build; first `borrowSender()`/`sender()` creates it (then follows the ingest initial-connect mode) |
| `query_pool_min=0` | no query client at build; first query `submit()` creates it |
| both mins `0` | config-only validation at build; all network work is lazy |

After prewarm, both pools grow lazily up to `max` on demand, and shrink back to
`min` when idle. Growth uses the same real connect path as prewarm. At `max`,
callers block up to `acquire_timeout_ms` then throw.

---

## Defaults (single source of truth)

### Pool (facade only)

| Key / builder | Default |
| --- | ---: |
| `sender_pool_min` | `1` |
| `sender_pool_max` | `4` |
| `query_pool_min` | `1` |
| `query_pool_max` | `4` |
| `acquire_timeout_ms` | `5000` |
| `idle_timeout_ms` | `60000` (`0` ⇒ infinite) |
| `max_lifetime_ms` | `1800000` (`0` ⇒ infinite) |
| `housekeeper_interval_ms` | `5000` |

### Ingest sender (SF + reconnect)

| Key | Default |
| --- | ---: |
| `sender_id` | `default` |
| `sf_max_bytes` (segment size) | `4 MiB` |
| `sf_max_total_bytes` (SF mode) | `10 GiB` |
| `sf_durability` | `MEMORY` |
| `sf_append_deadline_millis` | `30000` |
| `reconnect_max_duration_millis` | `300000` (`0` ⇒ **give up immediately**, not infinite ⚠) |
| `reconnect_initial_backoff_millis` | `100` |
| `reconnect_max_backoff_millis` | `5000` |
| `close_flush_timeout_millis` | `60000` |
| `auth_timeout_ms` | `15000` |

### Query client

| Key | Default |
| --- | ---: |
| `target` | `any` |
| `failover` | `on` |
| `failover_max_attempts` | `8` (incl. original) |
| `failover_max_duration_ms` | `30000` (`0` disables the duration cap) |
| `failover_backoff_initial_ms` | `50` |
| `failover_backoff_max_ms` | `1000` |
| `auth_timeout_ms` | `15000` |
| `serverInfoTimeoutMs` | `5000` (builder API only — no config key ⚠) |

Note the inconsistent `0` convention: `idle_timeout_ms=0`/`max_lifetime_ms=0`
mean *infinite*, but `reconnect_max_duration_millis=0` means *give up now*
([sharp edge #2](#sharp-edges)).

## Knob availability by surface

Three configuration surfaces exist. Not every knob is reachable from every
surface — this matrix shows where each lives.

- **Conn string**: a `ws`/`wss` config string. Works for `Sender.fromConfig`,
  `QwpQueryClient.fromConfig`, and `QuestDB.connect(...)`.
- **Sender builder**: `Sender.builder(...)` (`LineSenderBuilder`) — direct
  ingest only.
- **Facade builder**: `QuestDB.builder()` (`QuestDBBuilder`) — pool knobs only;
  query/ingest behavior must come from the conn string.

| Knob | Conn string | Sender builder | Facade builder |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `addr` | ✅ | ✅ `address()/port()` | via conn string |
| `username`/`password`/`token` | ✅ | ✅ | via conn string |
| `tls_verify`/`tls_roots` | ✅ | ✅ | via conn string |
| `auth_timeout_ms` | ✅ | ✅ | via conn string |
| `initial_connect_retry` | ✅ | ✅ `initialConnectMode()` | via conn string |
| `reconnect_*` | ✅ | ✅ | via conn string |
| `sf_dir`/`sender_id`/`sf_*` | ✅ | ✅ | via conn string |
| `request_durable_ack` | ✅ | ✅ | via conn string |
| `close_flush_timeout_millis` | ✅ | ✅ | via conn string |
| `SenderErrorHandler` | ❌ | ✅ `errorHandler()` | ❌ (not reachable) |
| `SenderConnectionListener` | ❌ | ✅ `connectionListener()` | ❌ (not reachable) |
| `target` | ✅ | n/a | via conn string |
| `failover`/`failover_*` | ✅ | n/a | via conn string |
| `serverInfoTimeoutMs` | ❌ | n/a | ❌ (QwpQueryClient builder only) |
| `sender_pool_*`/`query_pool_*` | ✅ | n/a | ✅ |
| `acquire_timeout_ms`/`idle_timeout_ms`/`max_lifetime_ms` | ✅ | n/a | ✅ |

⚠ Gaps worth noting: the ingest **error handler / connection listener** cannot
be installed through the facade at all, and **`serverInfoTimeoutMs`** has no
config key, so a facade query client cannot tune it
([sharp edge #6](#sharp-edges)).

## Known sharp edges

Each item links to a tracked issue in
[`qwp-client-ergonomics-issues.md`](./qwp-client-ergonomics-issues.md).
"Intended" means it is a deliberate contract; "Candidate" means it is a likely
ergonomic defect worth changing.

| # | Sharp edge | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `initial_connect_retry` is implicitly promoted to `SYNC` when any `reconnect_*` knob is set — a resilience knob silently makes startup block. | Candidate |
| 2 | `reconnect_max_duration_millis` name implies "reconnect only" but also governs initial connect; `0` means "give up now" while sibling `0`s mean "infinite"; no infinite mode exists. | Candidate |
| 3 | `failover` sounds like it covers startup but only affects post-connect query `execute()`. Queries have no async/lazy initial connect at all. | Candidate |
| 4 | No first-class write-only facade: a write-only user must still supply a query config and remember `query_pool_min=0`. | Candidate |
| 5 | A single endpoint returning `401`/`403` is treated as cluster-wide terminal and aborts the whole endpoint walk, even at startup, even if other endpoints would accept the credentials. | Intended (documented), revisit |
| 6 | Ingest `errorHandler`/`connectionListener` and query `serverInfoTimeoutMs` are unreachable from the facade. | Candidate |
| 7 | The simplest API (`fromConfig` + async) has the worst error visibility — terminal async failures surface only on later producer calls or at `close()`. | Candidate |
| 8 | No client-side TCP connect timeout: a black-holed host in `addr` blocks the endpoint walk until the OS connect timeout. | Intended (transport limitation), revisit |

## Reference

### Store-and-forward semantics

`sf_dir=...` enables SF. There is no separate boolean enable flag.

- The sender owns one slot: `<sf_dir>/<sender_id>/`. Default `sender_id` is
  `default`.
- Multiple independent senders sharing one `sf_dir` must use distinct
  `sender_id` values, else the second fails because the slot lock is held.
- In pooled `QuestDB` usage, `SenderPool` derives per-slot IDs from the base:
  `<base>-0`, `<base>-1`, … so pooled senders never collide.
- On restart, the cursor engine opens existing segment files and replays
  unacknowledged frames; acknowledged/truncated frames are not replayed.

`flush()` semantics (QWP sender):

- Encodes pending rows into the cursor engine.
- In SF mode, data is persisted to mmap-backed segment files before `flush()`
  returns.
- `flush()` does **not** wait for server ACKs unless backpressure requires
  space. The I/O thread sends frames and trims ACKed frames asynchronously.
- `drain(timeoutMillis)` flushes and waits for the server to ACK all currently
  published frames, up to the timeout.
- `close()` flushes then waits up to `close_flush_timeout_millis` for ACKs,
  unless that timeout is `<= 0`.

### Async initial connect (ingest)

With `initial_connect_retry=async`:

- `build()` returns without a live socket; `wasEverConnected()` is `false`.
- Producer calls and `flush()` can run before the server exists; frames
  accumulate in the cursor engine (and on disk with `sf_dir`).
- The I/O thread retries in the background using the same loop used after wire
  failure.
- If a server appears before the budget expires, buffered frames are
  sent/replayed and ACK-driven trimming begins.
- If the budget expires before any connection, the sender latches a terminal
  `SenderError` whose message contains `never-connected-budget-exhausted`.
- If it connected at least once and a later outage exhausts the budget, the
  message contains `connection-lost-budget-exhausted`.
- Terminal async errors go to a configured `SenderErrorHandler`; without one
  they surface on later producer calls or at close-time.

There is no infinite-retry mode. For long maintenance windows, set a large
`reconnect_max_duration_millis`. On budget exhaustion the current sender stops;
persisted `sf_dir` data remains for a future sender on the same slot.

### Ingest endpoint walk (`addr=a:9000,b:9000,...`)

| Per-endpoint result | Sender behavior |
| --- | --- |
| DNS failure | transport error; try next endpoint |
| TCP connect failure | transport error; try next endpoint |
| TLS session/certificate failure | transport error; try next endpoint |
| HTTP upgrade timeout / non-auth transport error | try next endpoint |
| `421` with `X-QuestDB-Role: REPLICA` | role reject; try next endpoint |
| `401` / `403` auth failure | **terminal**; do not try later endpoints ⚠ |
| durable-ack requested but unsupported | terminal mismatch |
| successful write upgrade | bind this endpoint |
| all endpoints fail transport | throw / retry per initial/reconnect mode |
| all endpoints role-reject as replicas | `QwpRoleMismatchException` |

### Query client initial connect

`QwpQueryClient.connect()` is synchronous. Per endpoint it: opens TCP/TLS,
performs the WebSocket upgrade to `/read/v1`, reads the initial `SERVER_INFO`
frame, applies the `target=` role filter, and starts the egress I/O thread on
the first match. If no endpoint can be used, it throws. There is no async
initial-connect mode for queries.

`target=` matching:

| Target | Accepted roles |
| --- | --- |
| `any` | any role |
| `primary` | `PRIMARY`, `PRIMARY_CATCHUP`, `STANDALONE` |
| `replica` | `REPLICA` only |

Query initial-connect endpoint matrix:

| Per-endpoint result | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| DNS / TCP / TLS failure | record transport error; try next endpoint |
| HTTP upgrade timeout | transport error; try next endpoint |
| HTTP `401` / `403` | **terminal** `QwpAuthFailedException`; do not try later ⚠ |
| HTTP `421` + role header | role reject; try next endpoint |
| upgrade ok but no `SERVER_INFO` before timeout | transport error; try next |
| `SERVER_INFO` role ≠ `target` | role reject; try next endpoint |
| endpoint matches target | bind and return success |
| all endpoints transport-fail | `HttpClientException: all QWP endpoints unreachable ...` |
| all endpoints role-reject | `QwpRoleMismatchException` |

`auth_timeout_ms` bounds the upgrade/auth phase **after** TCP connect. There is
no separate client-side TCP connect timeout, so a black-holed connect blocks
until the OS timeout before the walk advances ⚠.

### Query execution-time failover

With `failover=on`:

- A transport/protocol terminal failure during `execute()` is intercepted; the
  client reconnects via the host tracker and re-submits.
- The handler receives `onFailoverReset(...)` before replayed batches.
- Bounded by `failover_max_attempts` (default `8`, incl. original) **and**
  `failover_max_duration_ms` (default `30000`; `0` disables the duration cap).
- Backoff: `failover_backoff_initial_ms=50`, `failover_backoff_max_ms=1000`.
- Auth failure during failover reconnect is terminal and reported to the handler.

With `failover=off`, a transport failure is reported to the handler with no
reconnect/replay.

### Scenario matrix

#### Facade startup

| Scenario | Config | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Default `connect`, all servers down | default mins | build fails |
| Default `connect`, first endpoint down, second works | multi-addr | build can succeed; each prewarmed client walks endpoints |
| Write-only-ish startup while down | `query_pool_min=0` + sender async | build returns |
| Fully lazy startup | both mins `0` | build returns after validation only |
| Query first use after lazy startup while down | `query_pool_min=0` | first `submit()` throws |
| Sender first use after lazy startup while down | `sender_pool_min=0` | first sender creation follows ingest initial mode |

#### Direct sender startup

| Scenario | Config | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| server down, default mode | no `reconnect_*`, no async | one attempt; build throws |
| server down, reconnect duration set, no mode | `reconnect_max_duration_millis=...` | **synchronous** retry; build blocks ⚠ |
| server down, async | `initial_connect_retry=async` | build returns; I/O thread retries |
| server returns `401`/`403` | any mode | terminal auth failure; no endpoint continuation |
| server appears before async budget | async + budget | buffered frames sent and ACKed |
| server appears after async budget | async + exhausted | sender terminal; new sender/restart needed |

#### Read-replica startup (one bad endpoint, another replica works)

| Bad endpoint type | Continue to working replica? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DNS failure | Yes | transport error |
| TCP refused/unreachable | Yes | transport error; black-hole waits for OS timeout |
| TLS handshake failure | Yes | transport error |
| HTTP upgrade timeout | Yes | after `auth_timeout_ms` |
| upgrades but no `SERVER_INFO` | Yes | after `serverInfoTimeoutMs` (builder only) |
| primary/standalone while `target=replica` | Yes | role mismatch |
| `421` role reject | Yes | try next |
| `401`/`403` | **No** | auth treated as cluster-wide terminal ⚠ |
| broken shared TLS/trust store | No | every endpoint fails |
| all endpoints down | No | `all QWP endpoints unreachable` |
| reachable but none match `target` | No | `QwpRoleMismatchException` |

### `QuestDBBuilder.build()` steps

1. Require both ingest and query configs.
2. Parse + validate both configs without connecting (runs even when mins are
   `0`; malformed pool/ingest/query/TLS/auth/enum/range values fail here).
3. Resolve pool keys: explicit builder setters override conn-string keys;
   conflicting pool values across the two conn strings fail.
4. Construct `SenderPool` and `QueryClientPool`.
5. Eagerly create `min` connections per pool.
6. Start the `PoolHousekeeper`.

### Initial-connect mode resolution (`Sender.java`)

```text
if initialConnectMode set explicitly -> use it (incl. OFF + tuned budget)
else if any reconnect_* set          -> SYNC
else                                 -> OFF
```

### Pooled SF startup recovery nuance

- Live/prewarmed sender slots recover their own unacked data via their
  `CursorSendEngine`.
- Non-live managed slots are scanned by the housekeeper startup recovery path,
  so `build()` does not block on stranded slots.
- Recovery of non-live stranded slots is best-effort and bounded: a build/drain
  failure aborts that scan; data stays durable for a later attempt, but the
  current process does not retry the aborted scan indefinitely.
- For immediate background drain of all slots, keep enough `sender_pool_min`
  slots warm or construct direct senders for the slots that must actively retry.

### Reconnect deadline (`CursorWebSocketSendLoop`)

`deadlineNanos = outageStartNanos + reconnect_max_duration_millis * 1e6`; the
loop runs `while (running && now < deadline)`. Hence `0` ⇒ no iterations ⇒
immediate give-up. `QwpAuthFailedException` / `WebSocketUpgradeException` inside
the loop are terminal across all endpoints.
