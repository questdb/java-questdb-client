/**
 * Chain of {@link MmapSegment}s presented to the user thread as one logical
 * append-only log keyed by frame sequence number (FSN). Owns segment
 * lifecycle: rotation when the active segment fills, ACK-driven trim of the
 * oldest sealed segments. Built for the cursor engine's split-brain threading:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Producer thread</b> (single user thread): {@link #appendOrFsn},
 *       {@link #installHotSpare}, {@link #publishedFsn}.</li>
 *   <li><b>I/O thread</b>: {@link #publishedFsn} (read-only), {@link #acknowledge}
 *       (single writer), {@link #drainTrimmable} (single reader).</li>
 *   <li><b>Segment manager</b>: polls {@link #needsHotSpare}, hands new
 *       segments via {@link #installHotSpare}, drains trim-eligible segments
 *       via {@link #drainTrimmable} on its own cadence.</li>
 * </ul>
 * No locks; the only cross-thread state is {@link #publishedFsn} (volatile,
 * single-writer) and {@link #ackedFsn} (volatile, single-writer). Hot-spare
 * handoff uses {@code volatile} as well — the segment manager publishes a
 * spare; the producer thread consumes it on the next rotation.
 * <p>
 * <b>Backpressure model:</b> {@link #appendOrFsn} returns
 * {@link #BACKPRESSURE_NO_SPARE} when the active is full and no spare is
 * available. The caller (engine) is expected to spin-park until the segment
 * manager catches up, OR until {@link #acknowledge} advances {@link #ackedFsn}
 * far enough that the segment manager can recycle a sealed segment.
